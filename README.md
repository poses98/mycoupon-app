# Coupon App with QR Scanner

Welcome to the Coupon App with QR Scanner! This project is built using [Expo](https://expo.dev) and created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Project moved to React web

The project was migrated to React web as there was going to be a little amount of users and deploying to app stores was not worthy.

Feel free to dive into the codebase that I made, although it is not a finished or maintened project.
