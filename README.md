# Coupon App with QR Scanner

Welcome to the Coupon App with QR Scanner! This project is built using [Expo](https://expo.dev) and created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

To get started with the app, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in different environments:

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

If you want to start with a fresh project, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
